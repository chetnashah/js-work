### Basics

#### Store :


Creating a store requires a rootReducer and initialState
```
const store = createStore(reducer, defaultState);
```

Store maintains state, get state from store
using 
```
store.getState()
```
Subscribe changes to state in store using
```
store.subscribe(observer)
```

#### Reducers:

A reducer handles actions to immutably change
given state.
A reducer signature always looks like 
```
(previousState, action) => newState
```

#### Selectors:

a function that knows how to extract a specific piece of data from the store. Like a lens.
Usually colocated with reducers.

### Data flow/lifecycle for redux in app

1. You call store.dispatch(action)
2. Redux store calls reducer function it was given.
3. Root reducer combines output of multiple reducers into single state tree
4. Redux store saves complete state tree given by rootReducer and can be retrived via store.getState()

### ES6 computed property syntax

We use ES6 computed property syntax so we can update state[action.subreddit] with Object.assign() in a concise way. This:
```
return Object.assign({}, state, {
  [action.subreddit]: posts(state[action.subreddit], action)
})
```

is equivalent to this:
```
let nextState = {}
nextState[action.subreddit] = posts(state[action.subreddit], action)
return Object.assign({}, state, nextState)
```


### Asynchronous actions

For any API request, you'll want to dispatch 3 actions:
1. An action informing reducers that request began.
2. An action informing reducers that request finished successfully.
3. An action informing reducers that request failed.

One can define seperate types for each :
```
{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_REQUEST' }
{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_FAILURE', error: 'Oops' }
{ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', response: { ... } }
```

### Reddit app state shape 

```
{
  selectedSubreddit: 'frontend',
  postsBySubreddit: {
    frontend: {
      isFetching: true,
      didInvalidate: false,
      items: []
    },
    reactjs: {
      isFetching: false,
      didInvalidate: false,
      lastUpdated: 1439478405547,
      items: [
        {
          id: 42,
          title: 'Confusion about Flux and Relay'
        },
        {
          id: 500,
          title: 'Creating a Simple Application Using React JS and Flux Architecture'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Reasons for normalizing state shape

Over time app will grow such that there will be
duplicate/nested state all over the place
and we would like to store it in a manner such as database. (e.g. user have posts which have comments which are given by users). Eventually all data in app will result in a graph. And relational model can emulate all possible graphs.

So the root state would consider tables for each
type of data e.g. user, posts, comments etc.
where the table is list of records by id.
and all of them refer each other only by Id.

Immutable updates require path copying and deeply
nested + more duplicated data will involve lot of
copying updating etc.

Normalization will result in overall flatter tree

### Concepts of normalizing data

* Each type e.g. user, comment, post etc. gets its own table
* Each table data is an object with a key allIds which is array of all ids, and a key byId whose value is an object where all the keys are ids of individual items and values are items themselves.
```
e.g. 
users : {
  byId: {
    "10001": {
      id: "10001",
      name: "JohnAha",
      age: "52"
    },
    "10002" : {
      id: "10002",
      name: "KateBaha",
      age: "66"
    }
  },
  allIds: ["10001", "10002"]
}
```

* Any references to individual items should be done using Id only

* The array of ids should be used to indicate ordering


### Our actions

#### Synchronous actions

User interaction generated actions:
SELECT_SUBREDDIT, INVALIDATE_SUBREDDIT

Network related actions, but also simple action cretors (return objects):
REQUEST_POSTS, RECEIVE_POSTS

### Redux Thunk middleware

By using this specific middleware,
an action creator can return a function (which takes in dispatch) instead of an action object. This way, action creator becomes a thunk.

When action creator returns a function instead of object,
that function will get executed by redux thunk middleware.

This function doesn't need to be pure; it is thus allowed to have side effects, including executing asynchronous API calls. The function can also dispatch actionsâ€”like those synchronous actions

### What are redux middlewares?

It provides a third party extension point
between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches
a reducer. People use redux middleware for logging,
crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing
and more.

redux notes:

### A standard action (also known as FSA - flux standard action)
A standard action
1. must be an object
2. must have type property
3. may have payload/error property

e.g.
```
{
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  payload: {
    text: 'Do something.'  
  }
}
```

### redux-actions library

Created to aid with utility helpers around redux FSA actions
to reduce boilerplate

Useful functions provided by redux-actions library
* createAction(type, payloadCreator = Identity) : create actions using this function
* handleAction(type, reducer, defaultState) : wraps reducers so that it handles actions of only a certain type
